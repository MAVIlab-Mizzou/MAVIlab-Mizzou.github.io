Emma Bennett is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Missouri-Columbia, where she works at the intersection of computer vision, graph theory, and deep learning. Since 2023, her research has focused on problems like graph matching, aerial image localization, and modeling vegetation structure for precision agriculture, often using Vision Transformers and large-scale spatial graphs. Sheâ€™s also exploring applications of quantum computing, particularly where it intersects with graph-based learning. Emma holds a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Mizzou and spent several years working as a consulting engineer before returning to academia. Her background in engineering brings an interdisciplinary approach to her work allowing her to tackle machine learning problems analytically with unique perspective.
