<!-- excerpt start -->
Prashanth Reddy Kotha and Minasadat Attari presented their poster, “Deep Style Transfer for Generation of Photo-realistic Synthetic Images of CNT Forests,” at the 2023 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR) in Saint Louis.
<!-- excerpt end -->
The poster introduced a deep-learning pipeline that uses style-transfer networks to create life-like synthetic images of carbon-nanotube (CNT) forests—imagery that can boost training data for downstream vision tasks. Great job sharing this work with the AIPR community!
