<!-- excerpt start -->
Our paper “Multi-Loss Topology-Aware Deep Learning Network for Segmentation of Vessels in Microscopy Images” was selected for an oral presentation at the 2023 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR) in Saint Louis, USA.
<!-- excerpt end -->

Mina Attari presented the work, which introduces a multi-loss framework that blends topology, boundary, and region cues to achieve precise vessel segmentation in microscopy images.  
Kudos to Mina and co-authors Nguyen P. Nguyen, Kannappan Palaniappan,for showcasing MAVI Lab research on the AIPR stage!
