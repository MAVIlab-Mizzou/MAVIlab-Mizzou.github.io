Congratulations to Sara Shojaei and Emma Bennett from MAVI Lab for winning 2nd place at the Graduate Student Association (GSA) Show Me Class Project event!

 Their project focused on segmentation and graph representation from satellite imagery, aiming to minimize mergers and fragmentations for more accurate and clean results. Using the refined segmentation masks, they extracted optimal graph structures to enable fast, robust, and reliable image-based localization under varying environmental conditions. Great work, Sara and Emma!
