# MAVI Lab at Mizzou

Welcome to the MAVI Lab, led by Dr. Filiz Bunyak. Our the development of AI/ML-driven methods for image data analysis. The systems we develop are applied across various domains, including interdisciplinary collaborations to advance scientific discovery in life and material sciences, evidence-based medicine, and geospatial image analysis for applications such as aerial surveillance, disaster monitoring, and precision agriculture.
